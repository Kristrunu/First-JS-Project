<h1>THE TO DO LIST</h1>

<p>
For this project I made a to do list where you can add to the list, check completed tasks and delete.
The list will not disappear if you close the browser and open it again. You can also filter the list so you will only see completed or uncompleted tasks.However I added the form for the list title later and was not able to make that stick when you refresh the page. I understand how, but did not have the time :)

<h3>I used:</h3>
<li>JavaScript to make the list and the list-title</li>
<li>CSS to style</li>
<li>Font Awesome for icons</li>
<li>setTimeout to display a pop up message after 3 seconds</li>
<li>setInterval to display a clock in the top/left corner</li>
<li>JS and CSS to make the animation when you check the completed button and delete a list item</li>
