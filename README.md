<h1>THE TO DO LIST</h1>

<p>For this project I made a to do list where you can add to the list, check completed tasks and delete.
The list will not disappear if you close the browser and open it again.
You can also filter the list so you will only see completed or uncompleted tasks.</p>

<h3>I used</h3>
<li>JavaScript to make the list</li>
<li>CSS to style</li>
<li>Font Awesome for icons</li>
